## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML
  -Bootstrap 5
- PostCSS, Autoprefixer, CSSNano

### What I learned

I used this challenge to take the opportunity to re-familiarize myself with Bootstrap. This was the first time in a few years that I've used it. It was pretty straightforward and very similar to using flexbox, so that part was easy. The biggest lesson I learned was to read the docs carefully. I had some trouble with the modal covering content even though the modal wasn't visible on the DOM. This was a result of my trying to use grid to center the modal vertically, rather than using one of Bootstraps existing styles.
